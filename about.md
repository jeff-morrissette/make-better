I love to solve problems with code.

I believe in a Test Driven Development approach and maintaining easy to read code (so I know what I am trying to say 6 months from now).

My favorite backend code to write is PHP (I mean really, who isn't) and am fond with using Laravel as a PHP framework and using React as a Front End framework (React: It's what's in style at the moment!)
